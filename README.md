Basic Site designed for a company that modifies cars. Design Inspired By Colorlib (https://colorlib.com/) and backend coded in PHP and database used is mySql. The exported DB can be found in the repo itself. 
It consists of some basic static pages and a admin portal to view the messages sent via the contact form and also to view the number of visits on the website.
Any Suggestions and Improvements are always welcome.
