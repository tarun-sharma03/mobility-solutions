# Mobility-Solutions
Basic Site designed for a company that modifies cars. Design Inspired By <b>Colorlib</b> (https://colorlib.com/) and backend coded in <b>PHP</b> and database used is <b>MySQL</b>. The exported DB can be found in the repo itself. <br>
It consists of some basic static pages and a admin portal to <b>view the messages sent via the contact form</b> and also to <b>view the number of visits on the website</b>.
<br>
<br>
Any Suggestions and Improvements are always welcome.
